                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>
                            Hi there! My name is Lars, and this is my website. On this page, I'll tell you about myself and what I (like to) do.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I got my degree in Applied Mathematics and I currently work as a junior software developer in the Netherlands. I like to work on my own projects in my free time, of which this website is one.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can find my GitHub and LinkedIn pages at the bottom in the footer of each page.
                        </p>

                        <h3>School</h3>
                        <p>
                            In <time datetime="2018">2018</time> I started my studies in Applied Mathematics, which I finished in <time datetime="2022">2022</time>. Applied Mathematics isn't a software development degree. In fact, I only remember about 3 or 4 subjects regarding programming, and only in Python and R. Still, I spent my internship and graduation period working for the company that currently employs me as a junior software developer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During my studies in Applied Mathematics, I learned about a lot of different mathematical concepts, of which programming is one. In the end, it's not so much about learning the ins and outs of these specific concepts, but more about being able to apply my knowledge to real world problems. I don't have to know exactly how everything works, as long as I know that problems can sometimes be translated into math, be solved, and then be translated back into common language. I learned logical thinking and problem solving, concepts that are very useful in software development.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Career</h3>
                        <p>
                            After graduating, the company that I spent my internship and graduation with offered me a job as a junior developer, and I still hold that position today.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At this job, I learned a lot about programming and software development, as my time at school was more focused on general logical thinking and problem solving. I quickly picked up on <abbr title="C Sharp">C#</abbr>, TypeScript, and <abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr>, which are the languages that the company uses to run their website. I spent most of my time in the backend with <abbr title="C Sharp">C#</abbr> and <abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr>, but I also dabbled in TypeScript and React for frontend work. Backend was definitely my favorite domain, but I knew frontend and database well enough to start calling myself a full-stack developer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In <time datetime="2024">2024</time>, I took an interest in broadening my knowledge with pieces of information that I could have learned if I had picked a more software-focused degree. I don't regret my decision in choosing Applied Mathematics as a major, but I had noticed there were some gaps in my knowledge regarding certain software development concepts and terms. If anything, my degree in Applied Mathematics helped me in a way that would allow me to learn more efficiently.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The company happily supplied me with the tools needed to start learning efficiently. I picked up on frontend matter like <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, I learned about manual and automatic testing, and I was taught concepts and terms that I wasn't (fully) familiar with yet. Continuing to study helps me to become a better programmer each day, which allows me to create the things that I want to create.

                        <h3>Hobby projects</h3>
                        <p>
                            Next to school and work, I also like to work on my own personal hobby projects. Whenever I work with some new thing at my job about which I want learn more, I'll set up a repository in my free time to play around with. This website is an example of such a personal project, as I decided to to learn more about <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Projects such as a chess app, a casino suite, and a comprehensive wiki site for my <abbr title="Dungeons and Dragons">D&D</abbr> campaigns allow me to grow as a developer and to express myself creatively. I'm learning new things and having fun learning them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can find more information about my personal project on the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> page, which you can find in the navigation bar at the top of each page.
