            <h2>First Steps at Learning <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr></h2>
            <section>
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    When I was an intern back in <time datetime="2021">2021</time>, by boss once called frontend development "coloring pixels". For some reason, that didn't really resonate with me. I was learning <abbr title="C Sharp">C#</abbr> for my internship, and I liked the robustness of <abbr title="Object oriented programming">OOP</abbr>. I liked creating objects and then having those objects interact with each other. It was all very structured and logical. Hearing the phrase "coloring pixels" made me think that frontend development was more of a classic art, like painting, and less of a structured way of having different elements on the page interact with each other. I thought you had to meticulously put every element exactly where it's supposed to go when creating a webpage. If you wanted to add a new element to the page, you'd have to color the pixels of the screen in the exact way that would allow the element to be made.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, I knew that my boss was making a joke at the time, but I didn't know how frontend development actually worked. I knew about <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, and JavaScript, but I didn't know how they worked. Whenever I was tasked with having something appear on the screen, I would just fiddle around with <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s and use the already existing TypeScript functions to create the desired elements. Only in <time datetime="2024">2024</time>, when I had worked as a junior developer for 2 years and put more focus on learning and personal development, did I start learning the ins and outs of frontend development. In this journey, I figured out that frontend development is more than "coloring pixels", and that it's actually very structured. Also, with the European Accessibility Act taking effect in <time datetime="2025-06-28">June of 2025</time>, I figured now would be a great time to start learning how I can make the web more accessible.

                <h3>More than coloring pixels</h3>
                <p>
                    I once spent a couple of weeks refactoring some old code that I wrote as an intern a couple years prior. The code was sloppy and hard to follow, it was kind of like how an intern would write their code. I fixed it up with all the new shiny techniques that I had learned and made it robust and efficient, with clear comments and documentation. At the end of the couple of weeks, I was done, and the feature worked exactly the same as it did before the refactor. I hadn't changed the actual user interface, it was still the same buttons in the same order and the results were displayed in the same way. I spent multiple weeks working really hard only for the end user to not notice any difference.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This experience made me realize that development is more than just "making it work". It's about writing readable and maintainable code so that other developers can more easily debug it. If you have a massive function that is hundreds of lines long, you're better off breaking it up in many smaller functions. That may not change the logic, the functions might still do the exact same thing combined as what the initial massive function did, but at least now you have modular code that is way easier to debug, you're not just writing code for the end user. You're also writing code for yourself and for anyone else that works on the same codebase.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I always knew this was the case for writing code in programming languages, but I only recently realized that this concept also applies to writing <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. The "coloring pixels" concept made me think that <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> was just a means of making your content appear on the screen in a way that looks good. <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> however, is much more than that.

                <h3>Semantics, not styling</h3>
                <p>
                    As a (primarily) backend developer with some experience with frontend development (TypeScript and React), my time spent actually constructing <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> has been limited so far. Usually when I was tasked to have something appear on the screen, I would call preexisting functions or copy and paste the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> from a different element. If I didn't like the position of an element, I would mess around with the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. Maybe I'd wrap some elements in a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> or use a <code>&lt;br/&gt;</code> tag to separate two paragraphs. I was using <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> as a means of styling the page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I didn't understand how <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> worked back then, and messing around with the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> got me the desired results, so I would be satisfied and move on. Of course, I would have no idea of the implications this would have on how the browser actually reads and understands the code. The implications being semantics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> doesn't just look at the document to decide which piece of content to put where and how to style each piece of content, that's mostly the job of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> looks at the document to decide what each piece of content actually means. Is it a header? A paragraph? A table? Once the browser knows what type of content something is, it can show it to the <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> in order to style it. It also knows how to treat the piece of content in other ways. You could use JavaScript to automatically create a table of contents of all the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, etc. tags. Screenreaders also know how to read each piece of content to the user. Is <em>emphasis</em> used? Define it with the <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tag. Is something <strong>important</strong>? Use the <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> tag. Note that these are different from <i>italics</i> and <b>bold</b> tags, which use <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> respectively. <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> are just simple styling tags, which you can use to style a piece of text however you want with <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. In contrast, the <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> tags hold actual meaning. They are used to tell the browser that the pieces of text within those tags should be conveyed to the user in a certain way. In a practical example, a screenreader will use actual emphasis in their voice when reading a piece of text wrapped in an <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tag, meaning you can hear it when it's being read to you. A person with a visual disability may not be able to see that the text is written in italics, but they will hear the emphasis through the screen reader. This means that marking up text is more than just showing the user some text, it is conveying the desired meaning to the user. This can be done through multiple channels, like seeing and hearing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The job of <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is to provide a structure to your webpage and to define the different elements that you use. It doesn't matter what the results actually look like on your screen, you can always change that with <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. It matters that correct meaning is conveyed to the browser so in turn it can convey that meaning to the user in whatever way is preffered.

            <section>
                <h3>Styling, not semantics</h3>
                <p>
                    Of course, semantics isn't everything. As you can see from this page, lack of styling can make a piece of content boring or maybe even difficult to work with. Wrapping a header in a <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> tag doesn't make it a neat bar at the top of the page. A table in pure <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> (which is to say, the default styling of most browsers) doesn't even have lines to divide the separate rows and columns, as you can see below.
                </p>
                <table>
                    <caption>This is a table!</caption>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Header 1</th>
                            <th>Header 2</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Content 1</td>
                            <td>Content 2</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
                <p>
                    I've made the decision to not use <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> in this article just yet. That is mainly because I want to get used to the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> semantics first. I also know that it can be very tempting to use the wrong tag just to change the styling of an element. Maybe an <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> in a certain style is a little too big, and I'd rather use an <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> element. If that were to happen, I would be sacrificing semantic meaning over the styling of my page, which means the value of <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is lost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A browser should be able to read a webpage as well as possible, providing the proper semantics is essential in this process. Once the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> code is valid and semantically sound, I can make the page look like anything I want with proper <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.

                <h3>Overdoing it</h3>
                <p>
                    You may have noticed that every time I write the letters <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> in this article, the browser provides a tooltip with the expansion of the abbreviation. It does this because I have wrapped the abbreviations in an <code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code> tag. Now, you might say that the definition of an abbreviation only has to be specified once, perhaps in the title of this article. I think, however, that specifying the definition of an abbreviation every time has value, even if it seems like overkill to do it this much.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my opinion, "overdoing it" doesn't have to be a thing. In terms of <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> code, you can never tell the receiver of the code too much in terms of semantics. You might choose to hide certain tags and attributes with <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, but having the browser know what each piece of content means and represents, means that the browser can always display it in the way that you want and that the browser can do with it what it needs to do with it. You could hide dirty <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> behind a layer of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and make the site appear exactly the same as a site with proper <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, but in doing so you forfeit meaning and semantics, which can lead to discrepancies in the future or accessibility issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's the same opinion I have when it comes to writing comments and documentation in code. You can figure out what many variables and functions are for by just reading the code itself, but adding comments ensures that even the most inexperienced <em>(or tired!)</em> developer can make up what's going on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the end, the receiver of the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> code just needs to know what each piece of content means. The browser can guess, sometimes it can guess pretty well, but providing it with the right context ensures that it doesn't <em>have</em> to guess.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h3>Underdoing it</h3>
                <p>
                    While you could spend time learning all the different <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tags and what they're used for, you could also just wrap everything in a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. You could define your own tags by giving each <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> a corresponding class name and then styling them all with <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. If you do that, you only have to mark up content that you think needs to be marked up. You could have <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s in <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s in <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s, and as long as you write good <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, your page could look exactly the same as one where proper <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tags are used. So, what's the point?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The point is, as I've touched upon extensively in this article, semantics. The browser has no idea what your <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is supposed to represent, and maybe in 5 years, you don't either. As I've explained, the point of <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is to provide meaning and structure to a webpage. If you don't like the way a certain tag looks, change the styling in <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, <strong>don't</strong> forfeit meaning by changing the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm not saying that you should never use a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> or a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, they can be quite useful for wrapping multiple pieces of content or to style a certain piece of text. I am saying that you should always consider if there is another tag for your use case that you could use to give your content proper meaning.

                <h3>Beyond <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>; <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and JavaScript</h3>
                <p>
                    In this article, I've talked mostly about <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is only a part of what makes a webpage a webpage however. <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> can be used to style the page and JavaScript is used as a scripting language to interact with the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. There's much more to it that just creating simple static websites. I haven't even talked about things like <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>s in this article, which is something that many webpages have.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As is often the case with programming projects, different languages offer different advantages. In the case of web development, the three aforementioned languages are used together to create a user-friendly experience on the web.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <time datetime="2024-05-09">At the time of writing this</time>, I know very little about <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, and although I have experience in TypeScript, I bet there is also still a lot that I can learn about JavaScript. Perhaps I will write about my experience learning those languages on this blog as well.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is the language of the web. It is a means of communicating between webpage developers and their users, whoever they may be. It can be used to aid those who have trouble reading or navigating a page based on purely styling, and it can provide rules and guidelines for developers in order to write in a somewhat common tongue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> in the right way can make the web more robust and accessible for many different people. Using it in the wrong way could create horrible experiences for some, which is not only bad for them, but also for your website's traffic. I therefore hope that most developers strive for writing proper <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, not sacrificing semantics for an easier time creating a website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are plenty of <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tags that I still need to learn, and I'm sure I'm using some of the ones that I do know in a wrong way. Through trial and error I hope to learn all I can to be able to make webpages that use proper <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> in order to make the web a better and more accessible place for everyone.
