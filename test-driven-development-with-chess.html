                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Sometimes when I'm bored, I start a coding project of something that I enjoy doing. I've written projects about solving a sudoku, or finding the best strategy at beat-the-house poker. Chess has been an interest of mine for a while now, so it was only a matter of time before I started writing my very own chess application.

                <p>
                    Over the course of my development journey, I have tried a total of 4 times to create an application in which I can play chess. I would start writing the application, but I would run into complex issues regarding piece movement or code management every time. Every now and then, I would get a new idea on how to solve the previous issues. At such a moment, I had forgotten how the code in my old project worked and I would start a new one.
                </p>

                    Eventually, I settled on the <abbr title="Test Driven Development">TDD</abbr> approach. This made me to reconsider what is really required in order to play a game of chess, while at the same time forcing me to build a comprehensive test suite for my application. The application is written in <abbr title="C Sharp">C#</abbr> and hosted on <a href="https://github.com/LarsGast/Chess-Logic" title="Go to the repository">GitHub</a>.

                    In this article, I will walk through the steps I took to write the logic for a chess application using <abbr title="Test Driven Development">TDD</abbr>. I will highlight the hurdles I had to overcome and show the different decisions I had to make in order to make the application as robust and complete as I could.
