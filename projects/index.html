                        On this page, you will find some of the projects that I have worked on in my free time. Each project will have a short description talking about what it does and if the repository is public, a link to the repository on GitHub. Some projects might have an article that has some in depth information about the development process or challenges that I faced when working on them.

                                        This is the website that you're on right now! I use this website to track my own progress as a software developer and to practice with website-building.

                                        It is hosted using GitHub pages and most of it is written in pure <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> so that I have as much control as possible over how the site looks and feels.

                                        It is currently underdeveloped. I hope to get comfortable with <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> quickly so I can proudly present to the world what I am capable of.

                                I have been running multiple campaigns as a <abbr title="dungeon master">DM</abbr> for a group of friends. When I first started, I tracked everything in multiple <abbr title="Microsoft">MS</abbr> Word files, from the story to the locations to the characters. With keeping track of relationships between the various characters and locations I quickly realized that this method of storing information was unsustainable.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I looked around and found multiple websites online with which you can build entire worlds specifically meant for things like <abbr title="Dungeons and Dragons">DnD</abbr>. When trying these methods I found that I wanted to do things slightly different than was possible on these sites. This and the fact that I sometimes needed to buy a subscription for certain premium features brought me to make my own website.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Just like the site that you're on right now, I am hosting my wiki using GitHub Pages. So while it is incredibly useful to have a space to keep track of everything that happens during my campaigns (for both me and my players), it also helps me develop as a software engineer. As an example, the wiki is rapidly growing in terms of pages, so I had to be creative about the scalability of the site.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The wiki in entirely in Dutch, because all my players and I are Dutch.

                                The game of chess is complicated. After each player has made one move, there are 400 possible legal positions. One more move for each player means 197,281 possible legal positions. Chess is complicated, but it is also structured, programmable. I have been playing the game for a couple of years now and am working on my own chess application. I am not sure what I want to do with it yet, other than have fun while making it. Part of the point of this project is to have a working chess logic codebase which I could use anywhere I want in the future.

                                I have tried to make a working version multiple times, and I have multiple repositories saved in various places. Sometimes my motivation for a project diminishes and I stop working on it. Later, when I have learned something new that could apply, I find my motivation again and start over.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the latest version of this project I have decided to apply test driven development, so I can learn the ins and outs of that.

                                I've never been big on trying to beat the odds, but the math always fascinated me. What if I could find a way to turn the casino's favour into my favour? This question made me work on this project.

                                There are multiple parts to this suite, which is by design. I wanted to separate my code so individual pieces would be more easily maintained, which is the idea behind microservices.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I currently have a working version of a deck of cards repo, and a poker repo (which uses the deck of cards repo). I am also working on roulette and blackjack repos.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            This project is also the first time I have uploaded my code to NuGet, which is a code packaging service for .NET projects. This forced me to do proper versioning, which made my projects more robust and maintainable.

                                One of the first projects I have ever worked on, before I knew much about programming at all, was a Discord Bot.

                                Discord is a popular chatting service that you can use to communicate with people all over the world. One important feature of Discord is bots.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Bots can be used to automate sending messages, moderation, and they can even be used to play games within a chat channel.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This project is the first project I picked up on my own. I used Java to build the bot, had it join my own server.
