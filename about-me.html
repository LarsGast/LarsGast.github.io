                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Hi there! My name is Lars. On this website I document my journey to becoming a better developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I currently work as a Junior Software Developer in The Netherlands.

                <h3>School</h3>
                <p>
                    In <time datetime="2018">2018</time> I started my studies in Applied Mathematics, which I finished in <time datetime="2022">2022</time>. Applied Mathematics isn't a software development degree. In fact, I only remember about 3 or 4 subjects regarding programming in Python and R. Still, I spent my internship and graduation period working for the company that currently employs me as a software developer.

                <p>
                    In Applied Mathematics, you learn about a lot of different mathematical concepts, of which programming is one. In the end, it's less about learning these specific concepts, and more about being able to apply your knowledge to real world problems. You don't have to know exactly how everything works, as long as you know that problems can sometimes be translated into math, be solved, and then be translated back into common language. You learn logical thinking and problem solving, concepts that are very useful in software development.

                <h3>Career</h3>
                <p>
                    After graduating, the company that I spent my internship and graduation with offered me a job as a Junior Developer, and I still hold that position today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this job, I learned lots about programming and software development, as my time at school was more focused on general logical thinking and problem solving. I quickly picked up on <abbr title="C Sharp">C#</abbr>, TypeScript, and <abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr>, which are the languages that the company uses to run their website. I spent most of my time in the backend with <abbr title="C Sharp">C#</abbr> and <abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr>, but I also dabbled in TypeScript and React for frontend work. Backend was definitely my favorite domain, but I knew frontend and database well enough to call myself a full-stack developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In <time datetime="2024">2024</time>, I took an interest in broadening my knowledge with pieces of information that I could have learned if I had picked a more software-focused degree. I don't regret my decision in choosing Applied Mathematics as a major, but I had noticed there were some gaps in my knowledge regarding certain software development concepts and terms. If anything, my degree in Applied Mathematics helped me in a way that would allow me to learn more efficiently.
