                    In this site, I keep different bits of information regarding my journey in development. This includes projects, learning opportunities, and maybe some open-ended writing. It is meant to serve as a place to store my thought process and to provide easy navigation to the different project that I've worked on to highlight my skills in software development.

                    The site is very empty at this point in time. It also lacks styling and maybe some proper HTML semantics. The site is very young and my knowledge of HTML and CSS is still limited. Good thing the first article on this site will be about me learning just that.
