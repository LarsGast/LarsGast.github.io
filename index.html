                        Hello, and welcome to my website!

                    <p>
                        My name is Lars and in this site, I keep different bits of information regarding my journey in development. This includes projects, learning opportunities, and maybe even some open-ended writing. It is meant to serve as a place to store my thought process and to provide easy navigation to the different projects that I've worked on to highlight my skills in software development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Use the navigation located in the header of each page to navigate throughout the website. Below is a short description of each main page and what they contain.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="none-list-style no-style-link-group" id="nav-summary">

                                <p>
                                    That's where we are right now! It's the landing page of this website and can be used as a hub to move to different parts of the site.
                                </p>
                            </a>

                                    A place where I write about whatever it is that's on my mind. This can be projects, learning opportunities, or something else entirely.
                                </p>
                            </a>

                                <p>
                                    Here, I document what projects I have worked on or am currently working on in a <abbr title="curriculum vitae">cv</abbr> sort of style. Some projects might also have an article that explains my thought process and certain decisions that I have made.
                                </p>
                            </a>
                            
                        </li>

                            <a href="/about-me">
                                <h3>About me</h3>
                                <p>
                                    If you want to know more about me, this is the place to be. On this page, I'll tell you who I am and how I got to where I am right now.
                                </p>
                            </a>

                    <p>
                        The site is very empty at this point in time. It also lacks styling and maybe some proper <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> semantics. The site is very young and my knowledge of <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> is still limited. Good thing the first article on this site will be about me learning just that.
