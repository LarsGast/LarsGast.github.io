                    <h2>My Development Journey</h2>
                    <p>
                        In this site, I keep different bits of information regarding my journey in development. This includes projects, learning opportunities, and maybe some open-ended writing. It is meant to serve as a place to store my thought process and to provide easy navigation to the different project that I've worked on to highlight my skills in software development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The site is very empty at this point in time. It also lacks styling and maybe some proper <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> semantics. The site is very young and my knowledge of <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> is still limited. Good thing the first article on this site will be about me learning just that.
